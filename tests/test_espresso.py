"""
Tests for Quantum ESPRESSO (``pw.x``/``pp.x``) defect parsing and charge
corrections, using the MgO example data in ``examples/MgO_qe``.

The atomic-site potentials which the Kumagai (eFNV) correction is built from
are sampled from a ``pp.x`` ``.cube`` of the electrostatic potential, smeared
with a per-element Gaussian; the reference these are checked against is the
corresponding VASP calculation of the same defects, whose site potentials come
from ``OUTCAR`` core levels and so need no smearing.
"""

# TODO: This covers the correction values only. The remaining espresso tests live in
#  ``tests/test_quantum_espresso.py`` and ``tests/test_quantum_espresso_anisotropic.py`` on the
#  ``atharva_doped_QE`` branch and still need porting. Note that file is stale (last updated
#  2026-04-17, while ``examples/MgO_qe`` was reorganised into ``Defects/``/``Unrelaxed/`` subfolders on
#  2026-06-10 in 3bc32eaf, so its paths no longer resolve) and has the anisotropic test file
#  concatenated into it from line 845 onwards, so porting is not a copy-paste job. Also note the API
#  drift: ``test_analysis`` -> ``test_parsing``, ``RunParser`` is gone (use
#  ``doped.io.espresso.outputs.get_atomic_site_potentials``), ``code=`` -> ``calculator=``, ``beta`` is
#  now in Å rather than bohr (so ``beta=3`` -> ``beta=3 * BOHR_TO_ANGSTROM``), and ``pp_folder`` is no
#  longer a ``DefectsParser`` kwarg. Still to port, with the data each needs:
#  - ``Mg_O_Unrelaxed_+1``: its correction, and the comparison against VASP at matching ENCUT (this is
#    the tightest QE/VASP check, as the ionic positions are identical). Needs
#    ``examples/MgO_qe/Unrelaxed`` (already added here) and ``examples/MgO/ENCUT_400_Defects`` (90 MB,
#    already gzipped). Note it sits in a sibling folder of ``Defects/``, so it needs its own parse --
#    the stored ``MgO_defect_dict.json`` still has it as a 5th entry, from the old flat layout.
#  - ``DefectsParser`` behaviour: the projected-magnetisation warning, ``check_DefectsParser``,
#    ``skip_corrections``, the no-dielectric warning, the band-gap error, serial (no multiprocessing)
#    parsing, and the JSON round-trip. Needs nothing new.
#  - Re-deriving corrections from a loaded entry with ``get_kumagai_correction``, and the
#    correction-error (``kumagai_charge_correction_error``) checks. Needs nothing new.
#  - ``sxdefectalign`` comparisons: doped vs ``sxdefectalign`` site potentials for q = +1 to +3 and for
#    the unrelaxed case, at the default and at ``beta = 3`` bohr, plus QE-vs-VASP of both. Needs
#    ``examples/MgO_qe/sxdefectalign`` (already added here).
#  - Correction plots: 10 ``mpl_image_compare`` tests (side-by-side QE vs VASP eFNV plots, and doped vs
#    ``sxdefectalign`` potential plots). Needs the 10 ``QE_*``/``SST_*`` baselines in
#    ``tests/data/remote_baseline_plots``, which will need regenerating anyway.
#  - The whole anisotropic Sb2Si2Te6 set (``v_Sb_-3``, with a tensor dielectric, and with/without SOC):
#    the same four groups again. Needs ``examples/Sb2Si2Te6_qe`` (194 MB raw, ~50 MB gzipped); note
#    three ``examples/Sb2Si2Te6/*.json`` files differ between that branch and this one.
#  - Competing phases and DOS: ``examples/MgO_qe/Competing_phases`` and ``examples/MgO_qe/DOS`` are
#    added here but nothing exercises them yet; a ``CompetingPhasesAnalyzer``/``FermiSolver`` backend
#    for espresso is separate work (see the tracking issue).
